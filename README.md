1. Can you implement the sing() method for the bird?
    * How did you unit test it?
    > - Implemented unit tests for methods in Bird class. 
    > - Refactored code to return String instead of printing 
    the results in order to improve ease of testing.
    * How did you optimize the code for maintainability?
    > - Converted Animal class to an interface as there are no
    common methods to be abstracted and there is no current 
    requirement to instantiate an object of class Animal.
